0.002	2014-04-22	Almost total rewrite

 [ Test Suite ]
 - Test exported subs using Sub::Identify if it's available.

 [ Packaging ]
 - use Dist::Inkt.

 [ Other ]
 - Exceptions thrown in the wrapped constructor will report slightly more
   useful line numbers and so on in their stack traces.
 - Exported subs should run slightly faster as they are compiled from
   strings rather than being closures.
 - Exported subs will have a more consistent refaddr.
 - Updated: Use Exporter::Tiny instead of Sub::Install+Data::OptList.
